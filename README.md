# Womb

Womb gives birth to randomly generated characters and NPCs designed specifically for Dungeons and Dragons, fifth edition.

## Notes

* Names are intended to be bizzare and nonsensical
* Racial bonuses are not included in rolled stats for copyright reasons
* Each stat is rolled individually and no consideration is put into what stats are best for the character
* Each created character is completely ephemeral, if you want to save it, it up to you how to decide how to do so 
* Each race/class/background has an equal chance of getting picked, which may lead to you getting a monsterous/exotic race more often than not simply because there are more of them
* Statistically, within the first 1 million characters created by this tool, there is a 97.5% chance that two of them will have the same name
