# Womb

Have you ever been lacking inspiration for a new DnD character? Ever needed to create an interesting NPC on the fly? Perhaps you just wanted to roll some random stats or create a wonderous new character name. Womb can help!

Womb is a tool in the Demiplane suite capable of randomly generating fully playable characters and NPCs. Womb has a unique algorithm for naming characters that you are sure not to run into anywhere else. 

Womb randomly generates a character with the following
* Name
* Race
* Subrace (If possible)
* Class
* Subclass
* Background
* Standard Stats (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)

Simply refresh the page or click the refresh button to get a new character!

## Notes

* Racial Stat bonuses are now included, and randomly picked when necessary.
* Names are intended to be bizzare and nonsensical
* Each stat is rolled individually and no consideration is put into what stats are best for the character
* Each created character is completely ephemeral, if you want to save it, it up to you how to decide how to do so 
* Each race/class/background has an equal chance of getting picked, which may lead to you getting a monsterous/exotic race more often than not simply because there are more of them
* Statistically, within the first 1 million characters created by this tool, there is a 97.5% chance that two of them will have the same name
